# Nested Loops 

### Background
This activity is designed to help students understand the structure of loops and the importance of the order in which things are done within the loop. 
Students are assumed to understand a single loop structure in programming.

### Participant pre-requisites
Students understand variables, sequence, and the structure of for loops (regardless of the language). 

### Scaffolding / Differentiation 
* Single loop activity for warm up & for reinforcement/concept attainment for students who are struggling with loop concept.
* Show a dance move example to students that shows the concept of a dance move as a command in a loop/nested loop
* Start as a whole group, and split students out on concept attainment to develop and document more advanced dance structures.
* See pre-requisites and big idea above.


### Go!
1. Students will complete single loop activity as a warm-up
1. Introduction to activity - example silly dance?
1. Whole class activity (slide to the right, slide to the left, turn around 360*, say  !  Repeat this five times).
1. Nested Looped (slide to the right, slide to the left, turn around 360*, say woo!  Repeat this five times) and say hoo hoo after each loop of the above. Do this outer loop step 2x.
1. Break into smaller groups and develop more complex dance and document based on skill level and concept attainment. This allows for differentiation between the groups based on skill level/interest.
