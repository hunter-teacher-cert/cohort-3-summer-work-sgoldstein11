### Technique: Code Scaffolding (Formated Comments)

#### Well-suited to...
* When you want students to write their own code but you want to scaffold the result into a particular direction. This is useful when wanting the students to feel as though they have choice, but you guide them toward a sensible approach to solving/writing the code.  
* This is also useful for using code as an assessment tool.
* Also good tool for having differentiation in a classroom without making it obvious to the students.

#### Example
* When we completed linearSearch first, then complete binarySearch to build skills.


### Technique: Diagramming Algorithms

#### Well-suited to...
*  Understanding the concept of the code as a tool to map out the solution ahead of time
*  To clarify the coding process as groups are working difficult code.
*  Important to use as a communication tool when discussing abstract concepts in code.  
* To indentify the edge cases that might not be apparent without diagramming. 

#### Example
* When we completed diagrams for pointers/Nodes before coding - the only way most people could understand the concept.
* Our group stopped in the middle of a coding session to draw up what we were trying to say to each other (when our words alone created more confusion in the group).
  
### Technique: Intentional Grouping

#### Well-suited to...
*  Students with a wade range of abilities/confidence/experience.
*  The students feel more confortable/less intimidated when learning from peers rather than from the teacher only. You can also find ways to give extra credit  

#### Example
* Groups that have been made with homogenous mixtures for the programming course and part of the Ds course.
