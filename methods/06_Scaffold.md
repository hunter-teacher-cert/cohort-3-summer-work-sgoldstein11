# Nested Loops 

```java
public class Loops{

    public static void main(String[] args) {
    // 1. Nested looping

      // make a loop that runs 10 times


        // add a print statement to let people know the outer loop is running


        // make a loop INSIDE the loop you made, run it 5 times
        // if this loop seems to happen too few times, or if you get an error, talk it out with
        // your group, and then check with me to see if you've figured out why

          // add a message to let people know the inner loop is running

    
  	// 2. Looping & Conditionals
    
    
    // expand and intigrate activites
    // make a loop that runs 10 times

      // add a message to let people know the outer loop is running

      // if i is even
        // then loop 10 times
          // add a message to let people know the inner loop is running
            // every other loop print "i and j are both even!"



  }

### Background


### Participant pre-requisites
Students know about nested loops. Nested loops have been presented but students have not written the code themselves. Students have experience with conditionals and modulo and have the ability to incorporate it into later code. 


### Scaffolding / Differentiation 
* Comment codes to suggest what code students should be writing. 
* Choose the less experienced student to be the driver.
* Helpful grouping if needed
* Float time at tables
* Demo the code for the class 


### Go!
1. Review some single loop stuff we have done in the past.
1. Look at an example of a loop with conditionals so that students feel better about loops doing something more than just a single thing every time
1. Do a live code of a nested loop
1. Students work on intro activity, generally have 3 or 4 actvities like number 1 to let the students get a good deal of practive. Do this in partners or groups or informal grouping and peer support. 
1. Move on to more complex examples like #2, do 4 or 5.
1. Have students come up with something funny to do with a dual nested loop, vote as a class on which one to do, impliment it.
